### iPad media element fixed; plugin menus (first part)
- **iPad fix:** iPadOS Safari accepts FLAC through Media Source only as `codecs="fLaC"`, and the check is case-sensitive. The app asked for `flac`, Safari said no, and the iPad fell back to Web Audio (which iOS suspends in the background). The app now tries both spellings (regression test). Found from the capabilities table on the device.
- **Plugin and context menus (gateway):** "learned actions". A device may run a menu action only if LMS offered exactly that action in a menu relayed to that device; nothing is hard-coded per plugin. Server commands are never allowed this way, and shared-data changes need an admin. Context menus are added as entry points. Tests: 9 unit tests (matching, search text, never-list, admin-only, malformed, expiry and bounds, hostile menus); 4 end-to-end against a fake LMS (offered-then-allowed, tampering, per device and per player, server commands); mutation checks on exact matching and the never-list.
- **Web app:** Apps & Radio (every installed app and radio source, with icons); a generic menu view (folders, paging, search boxes, play/next/add, nested "More…", actions that return menus); "More…" on tracks, albums, artists and Now playing. Tests for action resolution, item classification and hostile menu data.

### Playback modes: Web Audio or a media element, chosen automatically
- **Why:** on the iPad, playback stopped whenever Safari went to the background, even with the silent keep-alive. iOS only keeps a page's audio running while a real media element plays. Android Firefox showed the same.
- **Core (`core/src/mux.rs`):** decoded PCM is re-wrapped losslessly as FLAC (24-bit verbatim frames) inside fragmented MP4 (`audio/mp4; codecs="flac"`). There's one init segment per sample rate, the timeline stays continuous across rate changes, and `set_time` re-bases after a flush.
- **Media-element output:** an `<audio>` element fed through Managed Media Source (iOS 17.1+) or classic Media Source. Played time comes from the element (handling rate changes); pause, resume, seek and stop are mapped onto it; played audio is trimmed so memory stays bounded.
- **Automatic choice, built in:** every browser's capabilities are checked when this device starts playing.
  - **iPhone/iPad and Android:** the media element, when the browser supports FLAC through Media Source; otherwise Web Audio.
  - **Desktops:** Web Audio (lowest latency, keeps running in the background).
- **Settings:** shows the mode in use and why, offers Automatic, Web Audio or Media element, and lists the browser's capabilities.
- **Gateway:** the CSP gains `media-src 'self' blob:` (Media Source object URLs only); its test pins it.
- **Core:** `Player::audio_exhausted()`. A pull that returns nothing while a track is still decoding is not the end of the audio.
- **Found while testing:**
  - Chromium rejects FLAC-in-MP4 when the sample entry's bit depth differs from STREAMINFO (regression test);
  - pause states are reported as "Paused { … }";
  - a stalled element won't play the last few milliseconds by itself, so stall detection re-arms when more audio arrives.
- **Tests:**
  - **Core:** FLAC and fragmented-MP4 output decodes bit-exactly through Symphonia at 22.05–192 kHz; CRC and UTF-8 coding checked against reference values; hostile PCM never panics; the end-of-audio signal is tested.
  - **Web app:** mode-choice, timeline and capability tests.
  - **End to end in Chromium,** in both modes: playback, real-time elapsed, pause, resume, seek, and LMS stopping at the end of the playlist (media element: three passing runs in a row).
- **Test hygiene:** the browser tests now sign out and remove their player from LMS afterwards. Six stale test players that had appeared for admin accounts were removed.

### Web app: favourites and playlists; playlist changes are admin-only
- **Favourites:** browse folders; play, play next or add stations and tracks. Icons come through the gateway's art relay (LMS icons, plugin icons, or image-proxy URLs only).
- **Playlists:** list with filter; playlist page with play/next/add, and play from any track. Admins can also create, rename, delete, reorder and remove tracks.
- **Policy change:** changing saved playlists (`playlists new/rename/delete/edit`) now needs the **admin** role. They're shared household data: a guest listener could previously delete them. Listing and playing stay open to listeners. Tests cover listeners refused and admins allowed, and argument validation is still checked as an admin. The app hides the editing controls from listeners.
- **Navigation:** the sidebar gains Playlists and Favourites; phone tabs become Playing, Library, Search, Queue and Settings, with a Library hub.
- **Fix:** a remembered player that no longer exists is forgotten. Before, the app kept polling it, LMS dropped every such request, and the page showed "music server unavailable". Regression tests added.
- **Tests:** 15 more commands in the gateway contract fixture (admin-only ones are checked both ways); id and image-path validation tests, including traversal and `javascript:`/`file:` inputs.

### Security fix: filesystem paths leaked in RPC responses
- **Found:** while starting on playlists in the web app. `playlists` responses carried `favorites_url: file:///…`, exposing the server's music folder layout to any signed-in user. The filter removed URL fields only by exact key name (`url`, `remote_url`, …), and LMS uses others.
- **Fixed:** responses are now filtered by **value** as well as by key. Any string that is a `file:` URL, or a URL whose host is private, loopback, link-local, IPv6 unique-local or a local name (`.local`, `.lan`, `.home.arpa`, …), is removed wherever it appears. `favorites_url` is also on the key list.
- **Tests:** a regression test fails without the fix; the value classifier is tested against 16 sensitive and 9 safe forms; and a live scan of ten real response types through the fixed gateway found no paths or LAN addresses.
- Deployed to the live installation the same day.

### iPad playback: background keep-alive, and a stuck end-of-playlist
- **Diagnosis:**
  - the live gateway log showed iPad Safari never attempting to resume after a drop: the whole page was suspended when backgrounded or locked, then restarted or reloaded. Android resumed within 10 s;
  - a 5-minute, 10-track soak at 96 kHz/24-bit ruled out memory: player memory was flat at 48 MB.
- **Fix:**
  - a silent looping `<audio>` element (served from the app, CSP unchanged) holds the media session while this device plays, so iOS keeps the page running;
  - the AudioContext is resumed when the page returns;
  - lifecycle events go into a connection log that survives reloads;
  - after a reload, the app offers **Resume playing here**, reconnecting as the same player.
- **Diagnostics:** Settings › This device shows buffered audio, downloaded-but-undecoded bytes and the player's memory.
- **Bug fixed (found by the soak):** at the end of a playlist, LMS kept showing the browser player as playing forever. The AudioWorklet reported played frames in batches of 1,024 and never reported the final partial batch, so the player never said "played out". It now reports everything once its queue runs dry. A regression test fails without the fix, and an end-to-end check confirmed LMS stops.
- **CI fix:** two art tests used jsdom's `Blob` as a fetch body, which Node 22 (used in CI) can't read; they now pass on Node 22 and 26.
- **Tests:** 9 new Vitest tests (keep-alive, persistent log, hostile stored data, blocked storage) and 2 worklet tests.

### Phase 2: the web app (first slice)
- **`web/app`:** SvelteKit + TypeScript, a static single-page app served by the gateway. It replaces the Phase 0 test page (`web/spike`, removed).
  - **Players:** sign-in with two-step verification; a player switcher with "this device" (the WebAssembly player, auto-selected once connected).
  - **Now playing:** art, track and format details, transport, seek, volume, shuffle and repeat.
  - **Queue:** jump, reorder, remove, clear.
  - **Library:** albums (five sort orders, infinite scroll), artists, album and artist pages, search; play now, play next and add to queue.
  - **Also:** Media Session lock-screen controls; light, dark or system theme; desktop and phone layouts. Artwork is fetched with the bearer token (never in URLs), at most 6 at a time so LMS isn't flooded.
- **Security:**
  - the build externalises SvelteKit's inline start-up script and fails on any inline script, event-handler attribute or `javascript:` URL;
  - a source-wide test bans `{@html}`, `innerHTML`, `eval` and similar;
  - components are rendered with hostile metadata (script/HTML payloads, bogus ids) and must show plain text with in-app links only (mutation-checked);
  - command builders validate every id and clamp paging and volume.
- **Contract test:** every command the app can send is pinned in `web/app/tests/fixtures/commands.json`; a Rust test runs each one through the real gateway policy. It immediately found that `albums` refused `album_id` (now allowed: numeric ids only, with negative tests).
- **Gateway:** CSP adds `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` (style attributes only); the CSP test now checks every directive.
- **Tests:** 37 Vitest + 17 Node tests for the app; CI builds the app, type-checks with warnings as errors, and runs them; the Docker, deployment and release checks cover the new layout.
- **Live:** against a real library (read-only, as a listener whose only player is its own browser): the full album grid with art, search, album pages, and FLAC 96 kHz/24-bit playback on "this device", with live progress and queue.

### Plugin releases
- **`tools/build-release.sh`:** builds `LyrionAnywhere-<version>.zip` and `repo.xml`, containing:
  - static gateways for x86_64, aarch64 and armhf Linux (cargo-zigbuild, musl);
  - `Bin/SHA256SUMS`;
  - the browser player.
- **Integrity:** the plugin runs a bundled gateway only if it matches `Bin/SHA256SUMS`, and restores the executable bit that zip extraction can drop. A development "Gateway path" is not checked.
- **Browser player:** when bundled, the plugin passes it to the gateway (`--static-dir`), so the player page is served at `/`.
- **Tests:**
  - 20 new plugin tests: checksum match, tampered, truncated, wrong platform, missing list; a launch refused with the reason shown; the executable bit fixed. Mutation-checked.
  - `tools/test-release.sh` checks the zip layout, checksums, static binaries per architecture and `repo.xml`. It runs in a new CI job on main and tags.
- **First real installation:** the plugin running the gateway on the LMS host, behind nginx on a separate proxy host. All checks passed. It showed that the plugin should set its directory at load (fixed earlier today).

### Plugin fix from the first real install
- For 5 s after LMS started, the plugin's status showed a wrong binary path (`/Bin/…`), because the plugin directory was only set when the gateway started. It is now set at load. A regression test drives the real `initPlugin` and fails without the fix.

### Phase 1: nginx and Docker
- **Docker image:**
  - a static gateway binary plus the browser player;
  - distroless base, with no shell; runs as non-root; private `/data` volume.
- **`deploy/nginx/lyrion-anywhere.conf`:**
  - TLS, HSTS, WebSocket upgrades, unbuffered streams, a 64 KiB body cap;
  - `X-Forwarded-For` overwritten, never appended.
- **`docs/DEPLOY.md`:** the plugin and Docker set-ups, notes for running behind a CDN, and a checklist.
- **Gateway:** the events socket now sends a ping every 30 s, so proxies with idle timeouts (Cloudflare closes after 100 s) don't drop quiet sockets.
- **Tests:**
  - `tools/test-deploy.sh` runs the image behind nginx with the example config, as a new CI job. 24 checks cover: TLS redirect, a single CSP, LMS/admin/traversal paths unreachable, sign-in, cookie flags, origin checks, WebSocket upgrades, private data files, and lockouts that hold against spoofed `X-Forwarded-For`. A mutation check confirmed the spoofing check fails with the common `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`.
  - A keepalive test, mutation-checked.
- **Fixed:** a flaky events test that checked the LMS subscription before it was sent.

### Phase 1: LMS plugin
- **`Plugins::LyrionAnywhere` 0.1.0** (LMS 9.0+):
  - settings for the gateway (enable, listen address, public URL, trusted proxies), each validated before it is saved;
  - users, roles, two-step reset, pairing codes, home-player grants, devices and the audit log, all through the gateway's admin API;
  - matching `anywhere …` LMS commands.
- **Gateway supervision:** picks the binary for the platform and runs it directly (no shell), with the admin API on loopback only. It restarts after crashes with backoff (5, 10, 30, 60 s) and stops when disabled.
- **Gateway:**
  - `POST` forms of the admin deletes, for LMS's HTTP client;
  - `--log-file`;
  - `anywhere` added to the reserved RPC commands, so remote users can never manage accounts.
- **Settings page:** every name is set as text, never parsed as HTML, because device names and audit details come from remote users. Validation messages that echo input are escaped. The page warns that anyone who can open LMS settings can manage remote accounts.
- **Tests:**
  - 140 Perl tests against stubbed LMS modules, including a contract test that drives the real gateway binary;
  - 5 settings-page tests, including a full render of the page with hostile names;
  - a new CI job, in which the contract test may not be skipped.
- **Bugs found by tests:** a missing `Slim::Utils::OSDetect` import, and an XSS in the settings error echo.
- **Live, in a throwaway LMS 9 container:**
  - the plugin loaded and the gateway started from the settings page;
  - the account commands worked, and sign-in through the gateway worked;
  - the gateway was restarted about 6 s after `kill -9`;
  - disabling it in settings stopped it;
  - a device named with an HTML payload was stored and shown as plain text.

### Phase 1: artwork and events
- **`/v1/art/…`:**
  - fixed path patterns for covers, the current cover (permitted players only), and plugin/built-in icons;
  - image-proxy URLs only if LMS itself handed them out, so a user can't make LMS fetch arbitrary home-network URLs (SSRF);
  - only real images are relayed, size-capped, with a sandboxing CSP (inert SVGs).
- **`WS /v1/events`:**
  - one LMS CLI listener shared by all subscribers;
  - events filtered to the caller's permitted players;
  - only playback-related event types; URLs and paths redacted;
  - revocation and permission changes applied within 30 s.
- **Bugs found and fixed:**
  - Image-proxy art could never load: axum decoded `%2F` in the path. Art paths are now validated raw, which also blocks encoded traversal.
  - The CLI still sent its old default MAC after the switch to accounts. The gateway correctly refused it; the CLI now uses the gateway-assigned identity.
- **Tests:** 18 new; all 8 art/events protections confirmed by mutation checks (one test gap found and closed).
- **Live:** real covers and icons served, LAN-address image proxy refused, unpermitted current-cover refused, events delivered to the right subscribers.

### Phase 1: browse and control (`/v1/rpc`)
- **Default-deny allow-list** for LMS JSON-RPC. Every argument is validated; only app commands learned from LMS's own menus are allowed; URLs and file paths are refused in every form; rescan is admin-only.
- **Player permissions:** admins control everything; listeners control their own devices plus admin-granted home players (admin API for grants).
- **Response filtering:**
  - removes LAN addresses, server identifiers, `file://` paths and stream URLs;
  - player lists show only permitted players.
- **Tests:** 40 new (policy matrix, 20,000 random inputs, integration against a fake LMS proving refused commands never reach it, filtering, permissions, app learning, grants). All 11 policy protections are confirmed by mutation checks.
- **Live (read-only):**
  - browsing returned 10,498 albums;
  - no file paths or addresses leaked;
  - `readdirectory`, `pref` and an unpermitted real player were refused and logged.
- **Found:** LMS drops the connection when a plugin command targets a never-connected player; the gateway reports 502.
- **Incident:** the build machine's disk filled during mutation testing and truncated one uncommitted source file. It was restored, and the mutation script now verifies every restore and reports build failures separately.

### Phase 1: optional two-step verification
- **TOTP, opt-in per user** (RFC 6238, verified against the RFC test vectors).
  - Users turn it on from the account panel by scanning a QR code (rendered by the gateway as SVG) or typing the key, then confirming a code.
  - Login then needs a code as well as the password.
  - Codes are single use. Wrong codes count towards lockouts.
  - A wrong password never reveals whether two-step is on.
  - Turning it off needs the password and a code.
  - Admins can reset it for a lost authenticator (admin API and `anywhere-gateway admin reset-totp`).
- **Schema:** migrations are tracked with `PRAGMA user_version`.
- **Tests:** 22 new two-step tests (RFC vectors, enrolment, login, replay, lockout, disable, reset, migration, endpoints, browser helpers). Mutation checks cover every two-step protection.
- **Live:** enrolment by QR, login challenge, replay rejected, fresh code accepted.

### Phase 1: accounts
- **Account store:** the gateway now owns accounts (spec D12), in SQLite:
  - users, with argon2id passwords;
  - devices, each with its own player MAC;
  - refresh tokens that rotate on every use, where reuse revokes the device;
  - single-use pairing codes and an audit log.
- **Public auth API:** `/v1/auth/login|pair|refresh|logout` and `/v1/me`.
  - CSRF header and origin checks.
  - The refresh token is held in an HttpOnly cookie for browsers.
  - Lockouts per username and per client.
- **Admin API** on a separate loopback-only listener, with an admin secret. `anywhere-gateway admin` commands for bootstrap.
- **Revocation** (logout, device revoke, user disable/delete, refresh reuse) ends live player sessions immediately.
- The Phase 0 devices file is gone.
- **Browser player:** sign-in page, silent sign-in via the refresh cookie, background token renewal, and device reuse across sign-ins.
- **CLI:** `--gateway` signs in with `--user`. The password comes from `ANYWHERE_PASSWORD` or stdin.
- **Tests:** 30 new auth tests (store, endpoints, admin API, revocation). Mutation checks cover every account protection.


### Phase 1: resume after network dropouts
- **Session survives drops:** the gateway session now outlives the client socket. A dropped connection is held for a 60 s grace period, and LMS never sees the player leave.
- **Heartbeats:** the gateway answers LMS on the player's behalf while it is away. Without this, LMS dropped the player after about 15 s, as found in a live test.
- **Redelivery:** gateway → client frames are numbered and redelivered on resume. A test race showed that frames written into a dying socket were silently lost.
- **Stream resume:** downloads resume by byte offset. Acknowledgement-paced relaying keeps the gateway within a 4 MiB window of what the client has confirmed. A live test showed network buffers otherwise absorbing whole tracks.
- **One session per device:** a newer connection for a device replaces the older one.
- **Browser player reconnects** automatically with backoff, queues outgoing messages while disconnected, and resumes broken downloads.
- **Live result:** a 20 s total outage against a real LMS. LMS stayed connected with its clock running, the session and download resumed, and page and LMS elapsed time matched afterwards (62.0 s).
- `docs/PROTOCOL.md` documents the player protocol.

### Phase 0: spike (closed)
- The Rust player core, Rust gateway, WASM browser player and native test CLI. See `docs/phase0-report.md`.
- Relicensed to GPL-2.0-or-later.
