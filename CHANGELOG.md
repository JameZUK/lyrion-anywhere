### Phase 1: resume after network dropouts
- **Session survives drops:** the gateway session now outlives the client socket. A dropped connection is held for a 60 s grace period, and LMS never sees the player leave.
- **Heartbeats:** the gateway answers LMS on the player's behalf while it is away. Without this, LMS dropped the player after about 15 s, as found in a live test.
- **Redelivery:** gateway → client frames are numbered and redelivered on resume. A test race showed that frames written into a dying socket were silently lost.
- **Stream resume:** downloads resume by byte offset. Acknowledgement-paced relaying keeps the gateway within a 4 MiB window of what the client has confirmed. A live test showed network buffers otherwise absorbing whole tracks.
- **One session per device:** a newer connection for a device replaces the older one.
- **Browser player reconnects** automatically with backoff, queues outgoing messages while disconnected, and resumes broken downloads.
- **Live result:** a 20 s total outage against a real LMS. LMS stayed connected with its clock running, the session and download resumed, and page and LMS elapsed time matched afterwards (62.0 s).
- `docs/PROTOCOL.md` documents the player protocol.

### Phase 0: spike (closed)
- The Rust player core, Rust gateway, WASM browser player and native test CLI. See `docs/phase0-report.md`.
- Relicensed to GPL-2.0-or-later.
